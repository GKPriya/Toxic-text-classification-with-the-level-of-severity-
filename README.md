# Toxic-text-classification-with-the-level-of-severity-
Introduction
Purpose: It is a common struggle and necessity for many
social media platforms to be able to identify toxic comments
Kaggle Competition: Toxic Comment Classification
Challenge
Dataset: comments from Wikipedia
Data Preprocessing
(1) Check for null values and remove
(2) Convert into lowercase
(3) Remove stop words
(5) Tokenizer
(6) Keras Pad Sequence
(7) GloVe Embedding(Global Vector for Word Representation)
● GloVe aims to achieve two goals:
○ (1) Create word vectors that capture meaning in vector space
○ (2) Takes advantage of global count statistics instead of only local information
Built a  LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
